  <h3>Reasons why I like Techno</h3>
  <p>
    The country where I was born, Georgia, has a huge fan base for techno music.<br>
    I enjoy the deep rhythms and the way techno creates an atmosphere where people can lose themselves in sound.<br>
    It’s also inspiring to see how DJs and producers mix tracks live to keep the crowd moving.<br>
    For me, techno is not just music, it’s a culture and a form of self-expression.
